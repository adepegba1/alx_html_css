# 🌍 My First ALX Webpage Project

This project represents one of my first hands-on experiences in HTML5 and CSS3 as part of my web development learning journey with ALX.
It combines HTML structure with CSS styling to build a simple but functional two-page website featuring a homepage and a tweets page.

## 📌 What I Achieved

Through this project, I learned and practiced:

### 🖼 HTML (Structure)

- Creating a semantic webpage layout using header, main, article, aside, and footer.

- Embedding images, tables, and external links.

- Adding navigation menus with links to multiple pages (index.html and tweets.html).

- Embedding live tweets from Twitter using blockquote embeds.

### 🎨 CSS (Styling & Layout)

- Using a CSS Reset to ensure consistency across browsers.

- Importing Google Fonts and applying them to headings and body text.

- Styling headers, footers, articles, and sidebars.

- Applying Flexbox to create responsive two-column layouts (article + aside).

- Adding media queries to ensure the page works on smartphones and smaller devices.

- Practicing with borders, spacing, font sizes, and alignment.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

This project helped me:

- Understand the separation of concerns (HTML for structure, CSS for styling).

- Build a multi-page website with navigation.

- Use responsive design with media queries.

- Start building the foundation for larger, more complex web applications.

## 📖 My Learning Journey

- This project is part of my early exploration into front-end web development. At this stage, I focused on:

  - Getting comfortable with writing semantic HTML.

  - Experimenting with CSS layouts (flexbox, borders, spacing).

  - Learning how to embed dynamic external content (tweets).

  - Building the habit of organizing code into separate files (base.css, styles.css).

- As I continue my journey, I plan to expand this knowledge into:

  - JavaScript for interactivity.

  - More advanced CSS techniques (grid, animations).

  - Backend technologies to complement my front-end skills.
